  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="MeR.jpg"/></p>
  <p>Hello, my name is Katie. I’m a graduate of Michigan State University with a Bachelor’s degree in Advertising with a concentration in Social Media. 
  While at MSU my biggest accomplishment, besides earning my degree, was getting Spartan Stadium accessible to all students. To do this I used Facebook 
  to bring awareness to the issue and keep everyone updated throughout the two year process. Many alumni and fans sent messages of support while sharing 
  their MSU experiences with me. Currently, I am a Freelance Digital Marketing Specialist.</p>
<p>Some of my future goals include completing a 10K on my handcycle, traveling to London, Italy, and Nashville, Tennessee. In my spare time you can catch
 me handcycling, crafting, knitting, trying all adaptive sports or sippin’ sweet tea out of a mason jar.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite developer vlogs and blogs to follow include:</p>
